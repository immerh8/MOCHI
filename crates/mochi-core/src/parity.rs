//! Redundancy profile, read side (spec §15, §22 step 6; Annex B.2.11 D21;
//! the wire layout is in [`mochi_format::parity`]).
//!
//! [`scan`] walks the commits from the head back to commit 0. For each it
//! finds the parity frames between the commit frame and its footer, checks
//! every data shard of the protected range against the hash table those
//! frames carry, and rebuilds the damaged shards of every group that has
//! enough intact shards. Rebuilt bytes go into an overlay
//! ([`HealedSource`]), never into the archive: `verify` stays read-only and
//! `repair` writes a new archive (§22.2).
//!
//! # Why the walk can heal its own path
//!
//! Commit *n* protects \[footer *n* − 1, end of commit frame *n*): its own
//! objects and commit record, **and its parent's footer**. So once commit
//! *n*'s range is healed, the parent's footer reads correctly, and it locates
//! the parent's commit frame and parity. Footers are therefore parsed, not
//! validated, to find the parity (a footer's digest covers its commit frame,
//! which may itself be what needs healing); each is validated after its
//! commit's range is healed, and the walk stops at the first that still
//! fails. The head's own footer is in no range: if it is damaged, the head
//! is found by the forward scan of [`locate_head`], as without parity.
//!
//! # Never wrong bytes
//!
//! A shard is replaced only when its hash differs from the table, the group
//! has at least *k* intact shards, and the rebuilt shard hashes to the
//! table's value. Tables come from frames whose own digest verified. And a
//! rebuilt byte is still only data: everything that reads it checks the
//! commit chain's hashes as usual, which no parity frame can satisfy for
//! bytes the writer did not write. A group with too many damaged shards is
//! left alone and reported (`PARITY_CAPACITY_EXCEEDED`).
//!
//! A commit's frames must agree with the commit (identity, range, layout);
//! frames that verify but disagree are a profile violation, and their
//! patches are dropped.
