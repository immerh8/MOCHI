//! Recovery and repair (spec §22, §22.1, §22.2; plan C8).
//!
//! [`plan`] is read-only. It walks the §22 ladder as far as this build
//! goes, decides what a repaired archive can hold, and returns a
//! [`RepairPlan`] naming the source of every snapshot it recovers and every
//! entry it cannot. [`apply`] takes an approved plan, surveys the source
//! again, and refuses unless the result is identical (the plan is what the
//! user approved, §22.2); it then writes the recovered snapshots into a
//! **new archive**, verifies that archive independently before publishing
//! it, and never writes to the source.
//!
//! # Owner decisions (2026-10-08, plan C8 status)
//!
//! 1. **Output is a rewrite**, as for compaction (Annex B D18): every
//!    recovered snapshot becomes one commit of a new archive with a new
//!    archive ID, published by the D13 mechanism; the source is kept.
//!    Object and file-version IDs, stored chunk bytes, and promised
//!    attributes are preserved (O19). Commit IDs bind footer offsets and
//!    cannot survive, so freshness anchors start over.
//! 2. **An entry whose content or metadata cannot be recovered is left out**
//!    of every repaired snapshot that held it, and listed by path, version
//!    ID, snapshots, and reason in the plan and the report only. Nothing in
//!    the new archive records the repair (no wire-format change): the plan
//!    and report are the record (§22.2 "record unrecoverable files and
//!    affected snapshots explicitly").
//! 3. **Ladder steps 1–6** in this build: the expected head and its
//!    footer, earlier footers (the forward scan of [`locate_head`]; the
//!    footer-history accelerator is not written by this build), checkpoints
//!    and metadata chains (catalog images), recovery manifests (a damaged
//!    image's snapshot manifest), and parity (C12, Annex B.2.11 D21).
//!    Independent copies (step 5, Annex B.2.12 D22) are taken when the caller
//!    names them; the bounded salvage scan (step 7, Annex B.2.13 D23) only
//!    when the caller asks for it. Each is reported as such in
//!    [`RepairPlan::ladder`], never as passed.
//!
//! **Parity runs first** although it is step 6: a Redundancy-profile
//! archive's damaged shards are rebuilt into an overlay
//! ([`crate::parity::HealedSource`]) and steps 1–4 then run over the healed
//! bytes, so a commit record, footer, catalog, or chunk that parity rebuilt
//! is used as if it had never been damaged (every hash is still checked).
//! **Copies come next** ([`crate::copies`]): byte copies of the archive, named
//! by the caller, donate whole frames over the parity-healed view where the
//! source's frame fails its check and the copy's passes, inside the commits
//! the copy agrees on with the source. A copy supplies bytes; the source
//! supplies the trust, so the survey below still verifies everything it
//! uses against the commit chain. Every donated frame is listed in
//! [`RepairPlan::donations`], and a snapshot whose commit only a copy can
//! show is labelled [`Trust::CopyConfirmed`]. A repair made complete by
//! copies is complete: its result is fully verified (D22 item 7).
//!
//! **Salvage comes last** ([`crate::salvage`], only with `--salvage`, and only
//! if the survey above left something unrecovered): the scan finds commits by
//! frame, decides which were published (their own footer, or a kept commit's
//! parent link), regenerates their footers (and, when it hashes to what the
//! commits record, the descriptor) in the in-memory view, and the survey runs
//! again over the trusted head's chain and the top of each salvaged segment,
//! in that order, so the trusted chain's snapshots are never replaced. A
//! snapshot that needed the scan is labelled [`Trust::Salvage`], an
//! unconfirmed commit is listed and never recovered, and any plan that used
//! the scan or stopped at its limit is **partial**, whatever it recovered
//! (D23 item 9).
//!
//! A group whose damage exceeds its parity is listed in
//! [`RepairPlan::parity`] (`PARITY_CAPACITY_EXCEEDED`), and what the damage
//! touches is left out as before: never rebuilt wrong.
//!
//! # Rules [delegated] (recorded in the plan, C8 status)
//!
//! * **Trust flows from the head** (§22.1, as in recovery): the commits
//!   used are the head and every commit reachable from it by validated
//!   parent links. A break in the chain ends it; nothing before the break
//!   is taken from a scan. Snapshots before a break are still recovered
//!   when a catalog bound to a trusted commit holds their history (a
//!   checkpoint image holds every earlier snapshot, §10.6), but their
//!   commit records, and so their commit IDs and times, are not.
//! * **Where each snapshot comes from.** The trusted commits are opened from
//!   the head down with every check of
//!   [`crate::publish::open_at_footer`] (an image, or its snapshot
//!   manifest when the image's stored bytes are damaged, D10.9); each
//!   catalog that opens supplies every snapshot it holds that no later one
//!   supplied. A snapshot no catalog supplies is **lost**, with the reason
//!   its own open gave.
//! * **What an entry needs.** A file version is kept only if every chunk
//!   verifies (stored and content integrity) and its logical stream matches
//!   its file-content hash ([`crate::read::read_version`]); any version,
//!   file or directory, also needs its promised attributes from a verified
//!   manifest bound to a trusted commit (delta or snapshot), and manifests
//!   that disagree about a version reject it. Nothing is invented (§22.1).
//!   Below an omitted directory, every entry is omitted too, because a
//!   namespace never holds an entry without its parent (§10.2).
//! * **Retention** is the head's, rebuilt from its segment's manifests
//!   (D10.10). Holds and expiry carry over to the snapshots that survive,
//!   at their new sequences; a hold on a lost snapshot is lost and listed.
//!   If the head's retention cannot be rebuilt (or the head itself is
//!   lost), the plan says so and [`apply`] refuses unless the caller waives
//!   it ([`RepairOptions::accept_retention_loss`]), which the report
//!   records: holds are never guessed.
//! * **Outcome and exit code.** `complete` (exit 0): every snapshot and
//!   every entry recovered, retention carried, and nothing after the head's
//!   footer. `partial` (exit 2): anything less, including any tail at all:
//!   even an *eligible* tail (D14) is a screen, not proof that no commit
//!   was there, and this slice has no salvage scan to look.
//!   `nothing_recoverable` (exit 1): no snapshot could be recovered, and
//!   [`apply`] writes nothing. A partial repair is never labelled a
//!   complete one (§22.2).
//! * **Re-verification** (§22.2): before publication, the new archive must
//!   reproduce the planned namespaces, attributes, and retention, and
//!   [`crate::verify::verify`] (restoration level, `fsck` depth) must
//!   report every dimension of its policy `PASS`. Otherwise nothing is
//!   published.
