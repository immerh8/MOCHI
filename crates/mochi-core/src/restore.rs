//! Restore engine (plan C6; spec §10.4, §20.1 "restoration", §23.3 #7):
//! write an opened commit's namespace, or one subtree of it, into a
//! directory.
//!
//! # Rules
//!
//! * **Nothing is overwritten or merged unless the caller asks**
//!   ([`RestoreOptions::on_existing`], owner decision 2026-11-11; spec
//!   §10.4 forbids only *silent* overwriting). By default ([`OnExisting::Keep`])
//!   every directory is created exclusively and every file is published
//!   without replacing: an entry that already exists at the destination, or
//!   that the destination filesystem folds onto another entry's name (case,
//!   normalization), is a `NAME_COLLISION` exception, the earlier entry keeps
//!   its bytes, and a colliding directory's subtree is not restored.
//!   [`OnExisting::Merge`] enters a directory that already exists (only a
//!   plain one the backend allows, [`RestoreDir::open_existing_dir`]) and
//!   restores what it lacks; an existing file still keeps its bytes.
//!   [`OnExisting::Replace`] also moves an existing regular file to where the
//!   user can get it back ([`RestoreDir::set_aside`]: the Recycle Bin or the
//!   Trash) once the restored file has been verified, just before it is
//!   published, still without replacing. Nothing else is ever replaced: a
//!   file where the archive has a directory (or the reverse), a link, or a
//!   special file stays a `NAME_COLLISION`. A directory that was entered is
//!   not counted as restored and gets none of the archive's attributes; it
//!   was the user's.
//! * **Names are never altered.** A name the destination cannot hold
//!   ([`RestoreDir::name_issue`]) is a `NAME_UNSUPPORTED` exception, and
//!   the entry and its subtree are skipped.
//! * **Traversal cannot be expressed.** Archive paths have no `.`, `..`,
//!   empty, or separator-bearing components (`catalog::path`), and the
//!   engine only ever creates single components inside directories it
//!   created itself.
//! * **Only verified files appear under their own names.** Each file is
//!   streamed into a temporary name in its directory ([`crate::read`]).
//!   Every chunk and the whole file's content hash are checked, the file is
//!   synced, and only then is it published. On failure the temporary file
//!   is discarded, so a damaged file is absent, never partly present.
//! * **Collisions are found before anything is written** ([`preflight`]):
//!   the destination's case behaviour is detected on the root, sibling
//!   names that it would treat as one are grouped (the first in path order
//!   is restored, the others are `NAME_COLLISION`), names it cannot hold
//!   are `NAME_UNSUPPORTED`, and top-level names that already exist there
//!   are `NAME_COLLISION`. Exclusive creation remains the authority: a
//!   collision the preflight cannot foresee (Unicode normalization) is still
//!   caught when the entry is created, and nothing is overwritten. With
//!   [`RestoreOptions::refuse_on_preflight_exceptions`] any preflight
//!   exception ends the job before anything is written.
//! * **Exceptions do not stop the restore.** Each is recorded with its path
//!   and code ([`RestoreReport`]). Only cancellation and failures of the
//!   destination itself end the job early.
//!
//! * **Attributes** (plan O6, spec §10.4.1) come from the manifests
//!   ([`crate::publish::promised_attributes`]). They are applied after a
//!   file is published, and to directories at the end, deepest first, so
//!   creating children does not disturb a directory's time or need write
//!   permission it no longer has. Setuid and setgid are removed unless
//!   [`RestoreOptions::restore_setid`] asks for them. Whatever the
//!   destination cannot apply is an `ATTRIBUTE_NOT_RESTORED` exception
//!   ([`RestoreReport::attribute_exceptions`]). If the attributes cannot be
//!   reconstructed at all (a damaged snapshot manifest), content is still
//!   restored and the report says the attributes were unavailable.
