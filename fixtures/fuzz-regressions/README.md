# Fuzz regression inputs

Inputs a fuzz target crashed on, kept byte for byte, one directory per target.
`crates/mochi-testkit/tests/c8_salvage.rs::salvage_fuzz_regression_inputs` runs
every file in `salvage_scan/` through `exercise_salvage_scan` on stable Rust.
CI's `salvage_scan` fuzz job also seeds from `salvage_scan/`; `foreign_sevenz/` is run by `crates/mochi-foreign/tests/sevenz_fixtures.rs` (the same bytes are in `fixtures/foreign/7z/`, which `fuzz smoke (foreign_sevenz)` seeds from). Files are named as libFuzzer wrote them (`crash-<sha1>`). Add a hand-built test
for the same case next to the one that runs the file.
