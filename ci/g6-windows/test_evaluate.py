"""Self-test for orchestrate.evaluate(): the verdict logic, on synthetic guest results.

    python3 -I ci/g6-windows/test_evaluate.py

Covers a good run and the ways a run must fail: a vacuous run (no complete
archive ever seen), a judge violation, broken controls (synced data missing,
unsynced data not droppable), a missing result, and a volume that does not mount.
