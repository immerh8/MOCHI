//! Operating-system integration (plan D6, decision O10): what the app does
//! when the shell starts it with arguments, whether that is the first launch
//! or a second one that the single-instance plugin forwards here.
//!
//! # Rules
//!
//! * **Paths from the OS stay in Rust.** The webview is told that an archive
//!   was opened (an [`ArchiveSummary`], as `open_archive` returns) or what the
//!   problem was. It never receives, and never sends, a path.
//! * **Two kinds of verb (owner decision 2026-10-16, replacing "nothing runs
//!   silently"; amended 2026-10-20).** The *panel verb* "Open with MOCHI"
//!   opens an archive read-only in an archive window (the empty one, else a new one, `crate::windows`). *Quick verbs*
//!   run in a small compact window ([`crate::quick`]; progress, then a
//!   one-line result with "Show in folder" and Close) and never open the main
//!   window: "Extract here" and "Extract to new folder" (`--extract-here`,
//!   `--extract-to-folder`), "Add to archive" (`--add-now`, at once), and
//!   "Add to archive…" (`--add`, a small form first: name, Browse…, format,
//!   level, `.mochi` options, OK and Cancel; nothing is written until OK). A quick verb
//!   never overwrites: when anything in the way exists, nothing is written and
//!   the extract plan for the same archive opens in the main window instead
//!   (the panel verb's screen, with the folder chosen in Rust). Explorer starts
//!   one process per selected item, so `--add-now` and `--add` launches that
//!   arrive within [`ADD_BATCH_WINDOW`] of each other are collected into one
//!   archive; a later `--add` launch joins the form while it is still open.
//! * **No secret on a command line.** There is no option for a passphrase;
//!   a passphrase option is refused by name, and the refusal never repeats an
//!   option's value. Encrypted archives ask for the passphrase in the window.
//! * **Arguments are untrusted.** Every path is checked (empty, NUL, length,
//!   Windows device namespace, a verb's path count) before anything touches
//!   the file system, and a launch that does not parse changes nothing.
//! * **Foreign formats are not parsed here.** A ZIP, 7z, RAR, tar, tar.gz, or
//!   tar.zst path (by extension, [`foreign_kind`], unless the file starts with
//!   the MOCHI descriptor frame: `crate::route`) goes to the same open path as the
//!   in-app "Open foreign archive" button ([`Foreign::open`], plan D8): the
//!   isolated helper lists it and the window shows the read-only foreign
//!   browser. An archive that needs a password is remembered in Rust
//!   (`Foreign::pending`) and the window asks for it, once, exactly as it
//!   does for the in-app path. What D8 does not support (a split ZIP, an SFX,
//!   an unsupported method) comes back as the helper's typed refusal.
//! * **Extract verbs are for `.mochi`.** `--extract-here` and
//!   `--extract-to-folder` on a foreign archive extract nothing, choose no
//!   folder, and open no compact window: the archive is opened for browsing,
//!   with a plain sentence that extraction from the shell is for `.mochi`
//!   archives. The user extracts
//!   from the foreign browser's own buttons, which show the plan first.
//!
//! # Command line
//!
//! ```text
//! mochi-desktop [VERB] [--] PATH...
//!   (no verb)               open PATH read-only (what a file manager passes)
//!   --open                  the same, explicitly ("Open with MOCHI")
//!   --extract-here          quick: extract PATH into the archive's folder
//!   --extract-to-folder     quick: extract PATH into a new folder named for it
//!   --add                   quick: the Add form for PATH... (name, format, OK)
//!   --add-now               quick: add PATH... to a new archive next to it
//! ```
//!
//! `--` ends the options, so a path that starts with `-` is still a path.
