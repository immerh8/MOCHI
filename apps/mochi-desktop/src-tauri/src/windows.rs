//! One window per archive, as WinRAR does it.
//!
//! Everything that used to be "the open archive" of the one main window is
//! kept here per window, keyed by the window's label:
//!
//! * the staged sources, the drop listener, the extract destination and the
//!   Test and Repair tool's state ([`WindowState`]);
//! * which open archives, foreign archives, waiting passphrases and running
//!   jobs belong to the window (`Archives::open_as`, `Foreign::open_as`,
//!   `JobRegistry::start_for` record the owner);
//! * where a launch event for the window goes (`launch::Launches`).
//!
//! Closing a window ([`WindowStates::release`]) closes exactly its archives
//! (which releases their readers), forgets its waiting passphrases and foreign
//! passwords and cancels its jobs. A writer lock is held by a job for the
//! length of the job, so cancelling the job releases it; no other window's
//! archive, job or lock is touched.
//!
//! The decision of *where* an archive opens is [`place`]: the archive is
//! already open in some window (focus that one), the asking window is empty
//! (reuse it), or a new window is made. It is a pure function so that it is
//! tested without a display.
//!
//! Window labels: `main` for the first archive window, `win-N` for the rest
//! ([`WINDOW_PREFIX`]), `quick` for the compact window (which has no state
//! here). `capabilities/main.json` grants `main` and `win-*` the same
//! commands.
