//! MOCHI Find: search the file names inside every `.mochi` archive under some
//! folders (plan D5 extension; spec §19.1 discovery, §23.3 #8 coverage, Annex
//! B.2.18 D28).
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! The walk, the opening of each archive, the matching and the coverage are
//! [`mochi_core::find`], shared with `mochi find` (spec B.2.18): the two give
//! the same answers. This module adds what belongs to the window.
//!
//! * **Scopes.** The user picks folders (the shell's "Find in MOCHI archives",
//!   the desktop entry, or the in-app picker). Rust holds the paths; the window
//!   sees them as text to show and never sends one back.
//! * **Scan** (a job: [`mochi_core::job::JobContext`] progress and
//!   cancellation, forwarded over a `Channel` as [`FindEvent`]).
//!   [`Scan::run`] walks the folders for `*.mochi` files and opens each archive
//!   **read-only** ([`mochi_core::publish::open_head`], which hash-verifies the
//!   catalog image before it is opened, then a search of the head). No file
//!   content is read or hashed.
//! * **Cache.** Per-archive name lists live for the session, keyed by
//!   (path, size, modified time). A new query is answered from memory; a new
//!   scan re-reads only archives whose key changed. There is no on-disk cache.
//! * **Query** ([`Finder::query`], [`Matcher`]): a name substring
//!   (ASCII/Unicode case-insensitive, matched against the last path
//!   component), or a glob when the text has `*` or `?` (matched against the
//!   whole component). Text with a `/` is matched against the whole path
//!   inside the archive.
//! * **Coverage** (§23.3 #8). Every result carries what was searched and what
//!   was not: archives that are Encrypted (names cannot be read without the
//!   passphrase), damaged, unreadable, not MOCHI archives, in an unsupported
//!   format, or too large to hold; folders that could not be read; linked
//!   folders that were not followed; limits that stopped the walk; and whether
//!   the scan was stopped. Zero matches with any of those is **incomplete**,
//!   never "no matches" (`complete` is `false`).
//!
//! # Rules kept
//!
//! * Archives are untrusted: names cross as escaped [`NameText`]; nothing here
//!   is parsed except through `mochi_core`.
//! * Read-only: archives are opened with `OsReadStorage`, never for writing.
//! * No symbolic link or junction is followed (no loop is possible); depth,
//!   folder, archive and name counts are bounded.
//! * An Encrypted archive is never opened with a key here: Find has no
//!   passphrase, and says so.
