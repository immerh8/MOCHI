//! One Open for every format (plan D1, D8): which reader a file the user
//! chose belongs to, and the single entry point the open dialog, the recent
//! list, a dropped file, and the shell's open verb share.
//!
//! The rule is **MOCHI wins**: a file that starts with the MOCHI archive
//! descriptor frame (spec Annex B.2 D12: the only valid offset is 0) is a
//! MOCHI archive whatever its name says. This matters because a MOCHI archive
//! in the TAR-compatible profile is also a valid zstd stream holding a tar
//! stream, so `x.tar.zst` may be either. Everything else is routed by name
//! ([`foreign_kind`]) and, for a name that says nothing, by the first bytes of
//! the common foreign formats. Both are hints only: the isolated helper
//! decides what the bytes are and answers `NOT_AN_ARCHIVE` or
//! `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT` for anything it will not read. No archive is parsed in
//! this process.
